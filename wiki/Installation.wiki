== Dependencies ==

Please make sure that you have the following software already installed on your machine.

  * [http://java.sun.com Java 5] (or greater)
  * [http://ant.apache.org ANT 1.7] (or greater)
  * [https://glassfish.dev.java.net GlassFish V2] 

== Steps to Follow ==

To work with XMPPJCA, you will need to install both the resource adapter (.rar file) and an enterprise application (.ear file) to interact with the resource adapter. 

=== Part 1 - The Resource Adapter (.rar) ===

  # Download this zip file and extract the contents to a local working directory.
  # Go to that directory, and create a file called project.properties. The contents of your file will contain project specific information to compile, as well as login credentials for the XMPP messaging server. Here is an example of the set of properties you will need to define:
        {{{
            project.home=C:\\eclipse\\workspace\\grapevineim-xmpp
            project.j2ee.home=C:\\glassfish
            project.xmpp.host=talk.google.com
            project.xmpp.port=5222
            project.xmpp.domain=gmail.com
            project.xmpp.username=ENTER_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
            project.xmpp.password=ENTER_YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
        }}}
  # Assuming 'javac' and 'ant' are in your PATH, run the main build file by executing the following command

  	{{{ ant -f build.xml all }}} 

    or simply 

        {{{ ant }}}

  # deploy
