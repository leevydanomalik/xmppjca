== What you will need ==

Please make sure that you have the following software already installed on your machine.

  * [http://java.sun.com Java 5] (or greater)
  * [http://ant.apache.org ANT 1.7] (or greater)
  * [https://glassfish.dev.java.net GlassFish V2] 
  * [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers (version 3.3)] (optional) 

== Installation: 5 Steps ==

To work with XMPPJCA, you will need to build and deploy both the resource adapter (.rar file) and an enterprise application (.ear file) onto your GlassFish server. But first you will need to check-out the XMPPJCA project from SVN (hosted by Google Code). 

----

=== Step 1 - Check-out the source code ===

To check-out the source code, refer to the [http://code.google.com/p/xmppjca/source/checkout SVN repository check-out instructions], or have a look at the screenshots below showing how you can add the repository and then check-out the project from within Eclipse using the [http://www.polarion.org/index.php?page=overview&project=subversive Polarion Subversive SVN plugin].

Your file structure will look something like Figure 3 below.

If it's not compiling, check to make sure that your GlassFish server runtime library reference (part of your project Build Path) is bound to the actual location of your GlassFish instance on your machine.

=== Step 2 - Create your project.properties file ===

Now that you have checked-out the code, go to the project's root directory and create a file called project.properties. The contents of your file will contain project specific information to build everything as well as login credentials for the XMPP messaging server. Here is the set of properties that you will need to define:
  {{{
  # fully qualified path to your project files
  project.home=C:\\eclipse\\workspace\\grapevineim-xmpp

  # fully qualified path to your glassfish installation
  project.j2ee.home=C:\\glassfish

  # project version ID
  project.version=1.0

  # XMPP server hostname
  project.xmpp.host=talk.google.com

  # XMPP server port
  project.xmpp.port=5222

  # XMPP server domain name for user account
  project.xmpp.domain=gmail.com

  # XMPP login username
  project.xmpp.username=ENTER_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE

  # XMPP login password
  project.xmpp.password=ENTER_YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
  }}}

=== Step 2.1 - TODO - Fix this in dependencies.xml ===

In the dependencies.xml file there is a hardcoded path to your project.properties file. You need to manually fix this path on your machine. I will fix this ugly hack very soon!

=== Step 3 - Build The Resource Adapter (.rar) and the Enterprise Application (.ear) ===

Now that you have a project.properties file created, you should be able to build the resource adapter and enterprise application, and package everything up with ant. Run the following commands from the project root directory (or from within Eclipse)
  {{{ 
  # build the Resource Adapter (i.e. JCA connector)
  ant connector 

  # build the Enterprise Application
  ant app
  }}}
