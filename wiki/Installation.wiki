#summary How to install XMPPJCA
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured

== Dependencies ==

Please make sure that you have the following software already installed on your machine.

  * [http://java.sun.com Java 5] (or greater)
  * [http://ant.apache.org ANT 1.7] (or greater)
  * [https://glassfish.dev.java.net GlassFish V2] 

== Steps to Follow ==

To work with XMPPJCA, you will need to build and install both the resource adapter (.rar file) and an enterprise application (.ear file). But first you will need to check-out the source code from SVN. 

=== Step 1 - Check-out the source code ===

To check-out the source code, refer to the [http://code.google.com/p/xmppjca/source/checkout SVN repository check-out instructions], or have a look at the screenshots below showing how you can add the repository and then check-out the code from within your Eclipse IDE using the Polarion Subversive SVN plugin.

Your file structure will look something like this (using Eclipse IDE Package Explorer View as an example)

=== Step 2 - Build The Resource Adapter (.rar) ===

  # Go to that directory, and create a file called project.properties. The contents of your file will contain project specific information to compile, as well as login credentials for the XMPP messaging server. Here is an example of the set of properties you will need to define:
  {{{
  project.home=C:\\eclipse\\workspace\\grapevineim-xmpp
  project.j2ee.home=C:\\glassfish
  project.xmpp.host=talk.google.com
  project.xmpp.port=5222
  project.xmpp.domain=gmail.com
  project.xmpp.username=ENTER_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
  project.xmpp.password=ENTER_YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
  }}}
  # Assuming 'javac' and 'ant' are in your PATH, run the main build file by executing the following command

  {{{ 
  ant -f build.xml all 
  }}} 

  or simply 

  {{{ 
  ant 
  }}}
 
=== Step 3 - The Enterprise Application (.ear) ===

  # blah
