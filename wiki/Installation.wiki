  # Download this zip file and extract the contents to a local working directory.
  # Go to that directory, and create a file called project.properties
  # Assuming 'javac' and 'ant' are in your PATH, run the main build file by executing the following command

  	{{{ ant -f build.xml all }}} 

    or simply 

        {{{ ant }}}

  # deploy
