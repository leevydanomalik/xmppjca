= Overview =

== What is XMPPJCA? ==
[http://java.sun.com/j2ee/connector/ JCA version 1.5 Resource Adapter] that lets you connect your J2EE application to an XMPP / Jabber instant messaging service like [http://www.google.com/talk/ Google Talk]. 

== Usage ===
TODO

== Motivation ==
Couldn't find a free, open-source implementation that supoprted inbound messaging, so I just built it myself. Also, see this very good implementation supporting outbound only [http://static.devel.it.su.se/xmppjca/usage.html XMPPJCA by Leif Johansson].

== Feature Highlights ==
TODO

=== Java Connector Architecture version 1.5 compliant ===
Complies with JCA 1.5 spec.

=== Supports Inbound and Outbound Messaging ===
This resource adapter implementation supports both inbound and outbound messaging. 

=== Supports Multiple Concurrent Inbound Endpoints ===
You can connect to XMPP service using multiple accounts (example: alex@grapevine.im AND sandy@grapevine.im) concurrently, send presence information for both accounts to the server, and then listen for messages to be routed to the different message-driven-beans for each account.

== Dependencies ==
*XMPPJCA* is built on the [http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/index.jsp Smack XMPP API] from Jive Software. 

== Supported J2EE Platforms ==
This resource adapter has been tested on [https://glassfish.dev.java.net/ GlassFish V2]. 

== Known Users ==
XMPPJCA is being used by [http://www.grapevine.im GrapevineIM].
